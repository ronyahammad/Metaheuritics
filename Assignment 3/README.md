## Requirements  

To evaluate the algorithms, the following DIMACS instances, available in the provided tutorial, should be used:  
- `uf20-01.cnf`  
- `uf100-01.cnf`  
- `uf250-01.cnf`  

### Metaheuristics Implementation  
- At least one of the implemented metaheuristics must utilize a multi-state method.  
- For this assignment, **Genetic Algorithm** and **Multistart Tabu Search** were employed to solve the aforementioned instances.
