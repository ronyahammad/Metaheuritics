The DIMACS CNF format is a textual representation of a formula in conjunctive normal form. A
formula in conjunctive (logical and) of a set of clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (logical or) of
a set of literals. A literal is a variable or a negation of a variable. DIMACS CNF uses positive
integers to represent variables and their negation to represent the corresponding negated
variable.
If we let xi represent variables that an assume only the values true or false, then a sample formula
in conjunctive normal form would be
( x1âˆ¨x3 âˆ¨ Â¬x4	) âˆ§ (x4)	 âˆ§(x2 âˆ¨ Â¬x3)	
where âˆ¨ represents the or Boolean connective, âˆ§ represents and and Â¬ is the negation of  .
Given a set of clauses C1,C2, â€¦.Cm, on the variables x1,x2,â€¦.,xn , the satisfiability problem is to
determine if the formula
 C1âˆ§C2 âˆ§. . .âˆ§Cm 

is satisfiable. That is, is there an assignment of values to the variables so that the above formula
evaluates to true. Clearly, this requires that each Cj evaluate to true.
The maximum satisfiability problem is to find an assignment of values to the variables to have the
maximum number of Cj evaluate to true. To represent an instance of such problems, we will
create an input file that contains all the information needed to define a satisfiability problem or a
maximum satisfiability problem.

I am using Brute force to solve the task and the files uf20-01.cnf, uf20-091.cnf, uf100-0430.cnf. 
Before doing that i have made file hoos.cnf having the following content:

c This Formular is generated by mcnf
