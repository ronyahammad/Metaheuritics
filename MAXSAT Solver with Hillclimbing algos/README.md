In computational complexity theory, the maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT) is the
problem of determining the maximum number of clauses, of a given Boolean formula in
conjunctive normal form, which can be made true by an assignment of truth values to the
variables of the formula. It is a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem, which asks
whether there exists a truth assignment that makes all clauses true. Hill climbing is mathematical
optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search.
Three DIMACS instances have been given:
- uf20-01.cnf : 20 variables, 91 clauses
- uf100-01.cnf : 100 variables, 430 clauses
- uf250-01.cnf : 250 variables, 1065 clauses
We have to implement the following algorithms under certain conditions:
- Next Ascent Hill climbing using 1-bit Hamming Distance neighbourhood.
- Multi start Next Ascent Hill climbing (MSNAHC)
- Variable Neighbourhood Ascent using up to a 3-bit Hamming Distance neighbourhood.
- Multi start Variable Neighbourhood Ascent (MSVNA)
